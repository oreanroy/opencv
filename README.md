collection of different code to my way in making of excellent computer vision application

Establishing a serial communication between arduino and my pc.

The problem statement was to detect the color of the ball and predict it. There were three different colored balls which were to generate different signals. Each ball made different pins on arduino board to get high. 

Later part of the project RasberryPI was used its GPIO pins were set high or low according to color.
